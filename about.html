                        <p>What is freelancing?
                            Freelancing is doing specific work for clients without committing to full-time employment.
                            Freelancers often take on
                            multiple projects with different clients simultaneously. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
                            considers freelancers to be
                            self-employed individuals</p>

                            work. Most freelance jobs
                            are available in the skills, service, and creative sectors, such as copywriting,
