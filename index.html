                    something then no one can stop you.Write your goals down and stick them to your bathroom mirror or
                    computer screen. Create a vision board and hang it on the wall. Whatever it takes, make sure you can
                    see your goals regularly. If they fall out of sight, they'll quickly fallout of mind</p>
